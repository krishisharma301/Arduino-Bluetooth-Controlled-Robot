# Arduino Bluetooth Controlled Robot

## Overview
A Bluetooth-controlled robot built using Arduino and HC-05 module.
The robot receives commands from a mobile application and moves
accordingly.

A real working demo video is included in this repository.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO / Nano
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- Battery Pack

## Working Principle
The HC-05 module receives wireless commands from a mobile app.
Arduino processes these commands and controls motor directions
using the L298N motor driver.

## Demo
See the demo folder for a real-time working video of the robot.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Arduino programming
- Bluetooth communication
- Motor control using L298N
- Embedded systems basics
